"""
grammar-coach — an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

Exposes grammar/style analysis as MCP TOOLS that any MCP host (Claude Desktop,
Cursor, Orcha, etc.) can call. Built from scratch with the official Python SDK
(FastMCP).

Design principles applied (see README):
  - Single-purpose tools with verb-noun names
  - Descriptions state purpose, inputs, outputs, and WHEN to use
  - Typed parameters -> auto-generated JSON input schema
  - Structured, predictable return shapes (dicts, never free-form prose)

Run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python server.py            # stdio transport (for Claude Desktop / Cursor)
